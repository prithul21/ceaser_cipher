# ceaser_cipher
Caesar Cipher in Python  This script implements a basic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher shifts the characters of the text by a specific value, wrapping around the alphabet. You can choose between encryption and decryption modes.
Features:
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Keeps non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
Allows user input for text, shift value, and operation direction (encrypt or decrypt).
How it works:
For encryption, the alphabetic characters are shifted by the given value.
For decryption, the characters are shifted back by the same value to retrieve the original text.
Usage:
Run the script.
Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Specify the shift value.
Choose whether to "encrypt" or "decrypt" the text.
Feel free to clone, modify, or improve the code!
